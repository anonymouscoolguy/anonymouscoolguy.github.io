# Abstract Data Types

An abstract data type is an abstraction of a data structure that provides only the interface to which the data structure must adhere. The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language (Javatpoint). Consider the following ADTs:

## Static List
Must support the following methods:
- `build(A)`: Make new data structure
- `len()`: Length of list
- `iter_seq()`: Output values in sequence order
- `get_at(i)`: Return value at index `i`
- `set_at(i, x)`: Set `x` to index `i`

## Dynamic List
The same as the static list, plus:
- `insert_at(i, x)`
- `delete_at(i)`

## Stack 
A stack is First-In-First-Out, and has the following methods:

- `push(x)`
- `pop()`
- `peek()`
- `isEmpty()`
- `size()`

## Queue
A queue is Last-In-Last-Out, and has the following methods:

- `enqueue(x)`
- `dequeue()`
- `peek()`
- `size()`
- `isEmpty()`

## Set
- `build(A)`
- `contains(x)` / `find(x)`
- `insert(x)`
- `delete(x)`
- `find_min(x)`
- `find_max(x)`
- `find_prev(k)`: Previous biggest value before `k`
- `find_next(k)`: Next biggest value after `k`

# Data Structures

Data structures are the actual implementation of the interface provided the ADT.

## Array-based List
This is an implementation of the *static list* ADT. An array-based list is represented as a consectutive chunck of memory and can be accessed by `memory[address(array) + i]`, which makes accessing an array constant. Just building and outputting is array is done in `O(n)`.

## Linked List
This is an implementation of the *dynamic list* ADT. Each value will be stored as a node and will point to the next value. Insertion and deletion take `O(i)` time, which in the worst case is `O(n)`.

## Dynamic Array
This is an array-based implementation of the *dynamic list* ADT. In this DS the constraint of the length of the array is relaxed, for example, instead of making an array of size `n` it makes one of `n * k`. And whenever the length equals size, the array is resized/reallocated. Resizing takes linear time but everything else is done in constant time.

# Practice

## Let's create a linked list data structure

Let's begin by creating an interface, `List`, that lists the methods our linked list must implement. This will be a direct representation of the dynamic list ADT (the method names must not be exactly the same).

```java
public interface List<E> {
    void add(E data);

    void remove(E data);

    boolean find(E data);

    void printList();

    int size();
}
```

Next, let's create a `Node` class in order to store both the data and a next pointer.

```java
private static class Node<E> {
    E data;
    Node<E> next;

    Node(E data) {
        this.data = data;
        this.next = null;
    }
}
```

Then, we will create our `LinkedList` class with a constructor and a `head` variable.
```java
public class LinkedList<E> implements List<E> {
    
    private Node<E> head;

    public LinkedList() {
        head = null;
    }

}
```

Now, let's continue by building each of the necessary methods, starting with `add(x)`:

```java
public void add(E data) {
    Node newNode = new Node<E>(data);
    if (head == null) {
        head = newNode;
    } else {
        Node<E> current = head;
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next;
        }
        current.next = newNode;
    }
}
```

`find(x)`:
```java 
public boolean find(E data) {
    Node<E> current = head;
    while (current != null) {
        if (current.data.equals(data)) {
            return true;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
    return false;
}
```

`remove(x)`:
```java
public void remove(E data) {
    if (head.data.equals(data)) {
        head = head.next;
        return;
    }

    Node current = head;
    while (current.next != null) {
        if (current.next.data.equals(data)) {
            current.next = current.next.next;
            return;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }
}
```

`printList()`:
```java
public void printList() {
    Node current = head;

    while (current != null) {
        System.out.print(current.data + " ");
        current = current.next;
    }
}
```

`size()`:
```java
public int size() {
    Node current = head;
    int size = 0;

    while (current != null) {
        size++;
        current = current.next;
    }

    return size;
}
```

## Very cool introductory problem

Consider the following problem statement:

> Write an algorithm to check if an expression containing different types of brackets (parentheses  ()  ,  square brackets  []  , and curly braces   {}  )  is balanced.  In a balanced expression, every opening bracket  (including  (  ,  [  ,  {  ) is matched with its closing counterpart  (respectively  ), ], }  ) in the correct order.

This problem is very tedious if one does not find the *right* idea. The idea is always when a opening bracket is encountered to add the closing bracket to a stack. Then always when a closing bracket is found it must match the next bracket in the stack. Also if the stack is not empty at the end, it is also unbalanced.

```java

public static boolean isBalanced(String expression) {
    Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();

    for (char c : expression.toCharArray()) {
        switch (c) {
            case '{':
                stack.add('}');
                break;
            case '[':
                stack.add(']');
                break;
            case '(':
                stack.add(')');
                break;
            default:
                if (c == '}' || c == ']' || c == ')') {
                    if (c != stack.pop()) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
        }
    }

    if (!stack.isEmpty())
        return false;

    return true;
}
```
