This is not a conventional post. I will try to use this post as a *sort of* habit checker for my running. In an attempt to increase my stamina, I will try to go running everyday (preferably in the morning). I could do the habit tracking in an offline environment, but I believe that putting this online (even knowing that noboby is going to see this) gives me more motivation to continue.

Progress:
